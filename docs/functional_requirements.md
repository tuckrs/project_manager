# Project Management Tool - Functional Requirements

## 1. System Overview
The Project Management Tool is a desktop application designed for local project planning and scheduling. It provides comprehensive task management, dependency tracking, and schedule optimization using the Critical Path Method (CPM).

## 2. Technical Architecture
- **Application Type**: Desktop application (Electron)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Database**: Local SQLite database
